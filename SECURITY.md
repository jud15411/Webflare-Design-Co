# Internal Security Policy for Webflare Design Co

## Our Security Commitment

We are committed to building secure software. As part of this commitment, we encourage a culture of transparency and collaboration. This document outlines the official process for reporting security vulnerabilities discovered within this repository and its associated services by team members, contractors, and other authorized personnel.

The goal of this policy is to create a safe, blame-free channel for reporting so we can address issues quickly and effectively.

## How to Report a Vulnerability (Internal Process)

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it through one of the following **confidential** channels:

* **Option A (Ticketing System):** Create a **confidential** ticket/issue in our internal project system. Please use the "Security" issue type.
* **Option B (Direct Contact):** Send a direct message to **Judson Wells CEO** 
* **Option C (Email):** Send an email to our internal security alias: **judsonwells100@gmail.com**.

Please include a clear title, a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and its potential impact.

## Scope

This policy applies to the code within this repository, its dependencies, and any directly associated development or staging environments.

## Non-Retaliation Policy

We treat all vulnerability reports as opportunities for improvement. **We have a strict non-retaliation policy.** Team members who report a vulnerability in good faith will face no punitive action, regardless of how the vulnerability was introduced. Our focus is on fixing the problem, not on assigning blame.

## Recognition

Engineers who actively discover and report vulnerabilities are essential to our security posture. We recognize these contributions through:

* Shout-outs in team meetings or company-wide announcements.
* Consideration during performance reviews.
* Spot bonuses or other internal rewards for particularly critical findings.

Thank you for helping us keep our code and our users safe.
